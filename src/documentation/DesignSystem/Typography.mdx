# Typography

### Introduction

Understanding the application content and theming layout, the need for concise and clear
communication to the user is evident. Typography is probably the only component of a design which
affects every other component, element and thus the whole application or the tool itself.

<div style={{ marginBottom: 30, marginTop: 30, border: "1px solid #d5d5d5" }} />

### Font

In order to implement an accurate font system, its vital to choose the font itself first.
Here at Haptik, we rely on Roboto but we are making a switch to <strong>Proxima Nova</strong> - keeping the
upcoming design optimsations in mind and the need for a clear-type font system.

#### Font Sizes

Here is the summary of the tokens and the font sizes and weights used:

<CodeBlock>
  <Table columns={FONT_DATA.columns} rows={FONT_DATA.data} />
</CodeBlock>

#### Usage

    <Text variant="primary">Tertiary - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</Text>
