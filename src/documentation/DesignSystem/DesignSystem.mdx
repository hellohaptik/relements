# Design System

### Introduction

A design system is a collection of designed and tested UI components, guided by clear design philosophy,
that can be assembled together to build any number of applications. A design system brings consistency in aesthetics and user experience while enabling a faster design
and development time.

To achieve a fully-functional design system, we utilized the following plugins eyeing their scalability and
their robust features.

### Features 💫

- <strong>Future-proof</strong>: Just hook your custom components to the design system and stay sorted! 😌
- <strong>Easy-to-use</strong>: Code-less and do more (kind-of) 😎
- <strong>Uses Modern apporach</strong>: Curated from the latest practices (as of 2021) 🔥
- <strong>Responsiveness</strong>: One less thing to worry. 😏
- <strong>Less Verbose</strong>: The API will be minimal 🍺
- <strong>Tokens!</strong>: All the variants will be tokenised - easier for both designers and devs to coordinate and
get things on rolling. 🖖🏻

need to add further customisations.
