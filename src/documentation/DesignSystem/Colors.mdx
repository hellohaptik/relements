# Colors

### Introduction

We interpret colors based on tokens which will be helpful enough to bridge the gap
between designers and developers, thereby establishing a clear communication.

<div style={{ marginBottom: 30, marginTop: 30, border: "1px solid #d5d5d5" }} />

### Color Models

We have grouped the colors based on their appearance and their meaning to our system. The groups
help our design team to realize the expected outcome and provide a resolution accordingly.

Keeping these terms in mind we have the following color models along with their tokens:

<CodeBlock>
  <Table columns={COLORS_DATA.columns} rows={COLORS_DATA.data} />
</CodeBlock>

#### Usage

    <Text color="blue.haptik">Tertiary - Lorem ipsum dolor sit amet.</Text>
