# Installation

## Prerequisites

This library heavily uses React Hooks. It needsÂ the following versions of `react` and `react-dom`

```
"react": "~16.8.6",
"react-dom": "~16.8.6",
```

---

## Using npm or yarn

We recommend using npm or yarn to install relements. It makes the installation process much more streamlined.

```
npm install relements --save
```

```
yarn add relements
```

---

## Import directly in browser

You can import relements directly using a `script` tag. You can download or link these files directly using a CDN.

```
<script src="cdn.hellohaptik.com/relements/1.0.0/dist.js">
```

> We strongly discourage this method as it includes all the components regardless of usage. It also becomes more difficult to keep the library up to date. Consider using this library with Webpack/Rollup instead.
